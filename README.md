Animatica unofficial NeoForge port.

A Minecraft mod for the NeoForge intended to load the MCPatcher/OptiFine [animated texture format](https://github.com/sp614x/optifine/blob/master/OptiFineDoc/doc/custom_animations.txt). <br/>

Animatica Foxified adds support for resource packs that use **custom animated textures** <br/>
This includes:
- Animated GUI textures
- Animated entity textures
- Animated block entity textures
- Animated armor textures

## Animatica Foxified DOES NOT support:

- Custom entity model part animations in 3D ([EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features))

**These features WILL NEVER be implemented in Animatica.** <br/>
